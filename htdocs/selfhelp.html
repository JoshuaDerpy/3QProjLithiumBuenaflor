                            Burnout is a state of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion because of excessive and prolonged stress. Burnout typically occurs when we work to much, feeling overwhelmed, unable to meet demands, and being emotionally drained. When stress continues,
                            you begin to lose interest in things you used to love.
                        </p>
                        <p class="sh-text-articles">
                            Common signs of burnout can include constant fatigue, muscle- and headaches, detachment, and isolation. According to HelpGuide, "Stress, by and large, involves too much: too many pressures that demand too much of you physically and mentally. Burnout,
                            on the other hand, is about not enough. Being burned out means feeling empty and mentally exhausted, devoid of motivation, and beyond caring."

                        <p>
                            Here are some tips, based on HelpGuide, to deal with burnout!
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Turn to Trusted People</strong> &mdash; Social Interaction is a need for human beings, and a natural antidote to stress, and it's even better if you talk to someone that loves you. It's good for you to connect with
                                your community, school, or work! It can help lessen your stress, and may even help you ease out burnout.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reevaluate your Priorities</strong> &mdash; It's important to ask yourself when you're experiencing burnout, "Am I neglecting something important to me?" Take time to rediscover yourself, find something you enjoy and
                                makes you happy! Get plenty of sleep, take a break from technology, and learn when to say "no" to your work for just a while.</li>
                            <li><strong>Have a Healthy Diet</strong> &mdash; Having a healthy diet can support your mood and energy levels! Minimize your sugar and refined carbs, reduce drinking caffeine and eating unhealthy fats. Eat more Omega-3 rich foods
                                (fatty fish like salmon) because they can give your mood a boost! Avoid nicotine and drink alcohol moderately. </li>
                        </ul>

                            Expressing gratitude can heavily improve your mood and lessen rates of stress and depression. Expressing gratidude can also make you optimistic, and it can also improve your social bonds and physical health (The Mental Health Benefits of Gratitude, 2020)!
                            Studies show that people who express gratitude can form more meaningful bonds and greater levels of happiness (Brower, 2022).

                        <p>
                            There are also studies that show having a <em>Gratitude Journal</em> can cultivate the attitude of gratidude and can improve mental health. People who write in gratidude journals are less likely to have toxic and negative emotions
                            than those who dont. Gratitude can reverse our priorities and can help us be more grateful and appreciate the people and the things we do (How Gratitude Changes You and Your Brain, 2017).

                        are subconscious or unconscious adaptive responses, both of which aim to reduce or tolerate stress. </p>
                    <p>When individuals are subjected to a stressor, the varying ways of dealing with it are termed 'coping styles,' which are a set of relatively stable traits that determine the individual's behavior in response to stress. These are consistent
                        over time and across situations. Generally, coping is divided into reactive coping (a reaction following the stressor) and proactive coping (aiming to neutralize future stressors). Proactive individuals excel in stable environments
                        because they are more routinized, rigid, and are less reactive to stressors, while reactive individuals perform better in a more variable environment.</p>
