							<h2>Stigma Against People with Mental Illness</h2>
							<p>Stigma against people with mental illness, or mental health disorders can be subtle or it can be obvious&mdash;but no matter the magnitude, it can lead to harm. People with mental illness are marginalized and discriminated against in a lot of ways, but understanding what that looks, sounds, and feels like and how to address and stop it can help.

					<h3>Stigma Against People With Mental Illness</h3>
					<p><em><strong>What is Stigma?</strong></em> According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, "Stigma is a set of a set of negative and often unfair beliefs that a society or group of people have about something." Stigma against people with mental illness often root out from the inaccurate or misleading representation it gets from media, especially movies and TV show. People with mental illness are just like people with physical sickness, they're sick and they need help as well. But because of the negative notions people have with mental illness, people who have them are often scared of getting help because of the fear of being treated differently by family and friends.</p>
					<p>Stigma often comes from people's lack of understanding or fear. And again the inaccurate information media, such as movies, give about mental illness. Stigma not only affects people with mental ilness but also the loved ones who support them, often their friends or families (American Psychiatric Association, 2020).</p>
					<p>The stigma and discrimination is especially an issue to diverse ethnic or racial communities and can be a hindrance for people in those communities who seek mental health services. The American Psychiatric Association has this for example, "in some Asian cultures, seeking professional help for mental illness may be counter to cultural values of strong family, emotional restraint and avoiding shame."</p>
					<p>The stigma of mental illness is universal. A 2016 study on stigma concluded "there is no country, society or culture where people with mental illness have the same societal value as people without mental illness." (American Psychiatric Association, 2020)</p>
				</div>
				<div id="HEOStigma">
					<h3>Harmful Effects of Stigma</h3>
					<p>Stigmatization can both contribute to symptoms worsening and a reduced chance of getting treatment. A recent extensive review of research found that self-stigma does indeed have a negative impact on recovery in people with severe mental illnesses. Among the possible outcomes are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>lowered hope</li>
						<li>reduced self-esteem</li>
						<li>heightened psychiatric symptoms</li>
						<li>problems with social interactions</li>
						<li>reduced likelihood of accomplishing treatment</li>
						<li>increased troubles at work</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A 2017 study involving over 200 people with mental illnesses over a two-year period discovered that greater self-stigma was linked to poorer recovery from mental illness after one and two years.</p>
					<p>According to a Lancet editorial, the effects of stigma are pervasive, affecting political enthusiasm, charitable fundraising and availability, support for local services, and underfunding of mental health research in comparison to other health conditions.</p>
					<p>Other harmful effects of stigma include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reluctance to seek professional help or treatment, and a lower likelihood of staying with treatment</li>
						<li>Isolation from others</li>
						<li>Total lack of understanding on the part of family, friends, coworkers, or others</li>
						<li>Fewer chances for work, school, or social activities, as well as difficulty finding housing</li>
						<li>Bullying, physical violence, or harassment.</li>
						<li>Health insurance that does not adequately cover the treatment of your mental illness</li>
						<li>The belief that you will never accomplish at certain tasks or that you'll never be able to improve your situation.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Addressing Stigma about Mental Illness</h3>
					<p>Research shows that knowing or having contact with someone with mental illness is one of the best ways to reduce stigma. Individuals speaking out and sharing their stories can have a positive impact. When we know someone with mental illness, it becomes less scary and more real and relatable.</p>
					<p>A 2016 review of research on addressing stigma concluded that efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination can work at the personal and population levels. The strongest evidence was for anti-stigma efforts involving contact with individuals with lived experience with mental illness and efforts with a long-term commitment.</p>
					<p>Educational anti-stigma interventions present factual information about the stigmatized condition with the goal of correcting misinformation or contradicting negative attitudes and beliefs. They counter inaccurate stereotypes or myths by replacing them with factual information. An example would be an education campaign to counter the idea that people with mental illness are violent murderers by presenting statistics showing that homicide rates are similar among people with mental illness and the general public (Corrigan et al., 2012). Most of the evidence on educational interventions has been on stigma related to mental illness rather than substance use disorders.</p>
					<p>Mental health literacy programs are also a common educational strategy. Educators, health professionals, and policy makers have recognized the important role of schools in addressing the mental health needs of young people and have endorsed the implementation of school mental health programs (Wei et al., 2013). There is evidence that some in-school mental health literacy programs improve knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking behavior, but more research is needed before decisions to scale-up mental health literacy campaigns to the national level. There is also some evidence that basic health education to improve mental health literacy may be effective in reducing stigma for school-age children; however, to improve public attitudes without negatively impacting self-stigma, the curricula need to be recovery focused and developmentally and cognitively tailored to different age groups (Wei et al., 2013). One such program is mental health first-aid, in-person training that teaches participants to respond to developing mental health problems and crises.</p>
					<p>These are only some of the ways to address the ongoing stigma surrounding mental illness. There are a lot more. We should note that we can help by being more open to advocacies and protests against the stigma. We as human beings should stand for each other, and eradicate the stigma around mental illness!</p>

					<h3>Raising Mental Health Awareness</h3>
					<p>Mental illness affects how a person thinks, behaves and interacts. Mental health problems can affect anyone, no matter what age, background, or walk of life they come from, and mental illness is a silent killer in modern society. According to research studies, the average life expectancy of those suffering from a mental illness has proven to be a 10-20 years less than the rest of the population. There is a strong link between physical and mental health. People with chronic illnesses are more likely to develop a mental illness and, conversely, people with a mental illness are more susceptible to developing a chronic disease. Mental health is therefore an extremely important issue when considering your total health and wellbeing. Apart from the links to physical illness, those with a mental illness often experience social exclusion. Over 70% of sufferers keep their illness or problems to themselves for fear of judgment by society and peers, which can be a significant inhibitor to raising awareness among the general population.</p>
					<p>By definition, "awareness" means having knowledge or perception of a situation or fact. To start raising mental health awareness, you must first consider what mental health means to you and those around you. This first step may seem impossible while a person practices social distancing. However, people can still raise awareness about mental health virtually.</p>
					<p>Anything you can do to raise awareness for mental health is a significant contribution. According to Mental Health America (MHA), one in five people will experience mental illness during their lifetime. Even with mental illness impacting so many people, there is still a lot of stigma attached to seeking help or talking about mental health issues. Mental health awareness campaigns are all about destigmatizing mental health issues and starting productive dialogues on mental health issues. Change only happens when people take action, and raising mental health awareness is an important action that almost everyone can take.</p>

					<h3>How to Be Involved In Raising Mental Health Awareness?</h3>
					<p>There are a lot of ways you can be involved in raising mental health awareness! Because of our current technologies, sharing advocacies, information, and experiences about mental health can now be done with the help of our good friend&mdash;the internet! In sharing experiences and information, a lot of people become truly aware of how mental health awareness can help everyone. In the same way we educate communities about physical health concerns such as heart disease, it&rsquo;s critical that we start conversations about what mental illness is, how to recognize it and the fact that it is a treatable illness.</p>
					<p>Here are some ways you can take to raise mental health:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Talk with everyone you know.</strong> Ask family, friends and coworkers how they&rsquo;re doing and really listen to the answers. If they give any indication that they are depressed or stressed out, let them know that there are resources available to help them. If you sense that they might be considering self-harm or <strong>suicide</strong>, encourage them to seek help immediately and assist them as appropriate.</li>
						<li><strong>Open up about your experience.</strong> If you&rsquo;ve struggled or are struggling with mental illness, share your story. Hearing another person is going through the same thing you are can be a relief. And, it can be the nudge a person needs to get help and look into treatment.</li>
						<li><strong>Encourage kind language.</strong> When you hear people around you talk about mental illness in disparaging terms, politely ask them to consider the impact of their words. Any language that reinforces the stigma of mental illness is harmful and might keep someone from getting help.</li>
						<li><strong>Educate yourself about mental illness.</strong> It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to misunderstand mental illness. Learn more about it and share what you learn. This includes talking with children about mental health in age-appropriate terms. Children are not immune to mental illness and can experience conditions like depression and anxiety as early as elementary school.</li>
						<li><strong>Coordinate a mental health screening event.</strong> Promoting an event or asking that mental health screening be part of a community health fair can encourage people to take action regarding their mental health.</li>
						<li><strong>Volunteer.</strong> Mental health organizations like Community Reach Center frequently need help with specific initiatives and ongoing efforts. Your phone call or email will be greeted with heartfelt appreciation.</li>
						<li><strong>Leverage social media.</strong> Platforms like Facebook and Twitter can be great forums for inspiring people to be open-minded and inquisitive when it comes to mental illness.</li>
						<li><strong>Encourage physical health that supports mental health.</strong> Help people understand that physical health can have a direct impact on mental health. Eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise and sleep all play a part in a person&rsquo;s mental and emotional state.</li>
